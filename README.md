## typed-vuex
> Warning: TypeScript 4.1 usage
> This package makes heavy use of TypeScript 4.1 features like [Key Remapping](https://devblogs.microsoft.com/typescript/announcing-typescript-4-1/#key-remapping-mapped-types) and [Template Literal Types](https://devblogs.microsoft.com/typescript/announcing-typescript-4-1/#template-literal-types), so you won't be able to use it with TypeScript version under 4.1

Also this package contains only type definitions, so it won't affect your javascript code in any way.
